What's your background?
-----------------------

I am Giuseppe, a JavaScript and web engineer from Italy who's lived and worked around the world for the past 8 years. In my spare time I like to work on open source software and build small and scoped projects.

What extensions have you built?
-------------------------------

I've built two extensions at this point:

 - [lesstabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lesstabs/gpdnlknekkniebhjbflbcglgibnfcaah) - closes and archives old inactive tabs automatically after 24h. It then lists them when you open a new tab. If you tend to have too many open tabs because you are afraid to lose things then you might find lesstabs useful.

 - [slowcalhost](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slowcalhost/ligggmdbifogncgnoihhcencanaheone) - it is an extension for web developers. It automatically slows down localhost and aims to encourage devs to build sites and web apps that are fast even on slow devices.

What motivated you to get started?
----------------------------------

When at the computer, I spend most of my time in a web browser and inevitably stumble upon UX issues, problems and opportunities to provide better experiences. When I build a browser extension I do so to solve a problem that bugs me.

I like to build browser extensions because they are micro products that are well scoped.

Do you have a monetization strategy for your extension?
-------------------------------------------------------

I have been thinking to push lesstabs a bit with the goal of trying a freemium model i.e. provide basic functionality to everybody and a paid pro version with other useful features including a tool to listen to articles.

What do you do, besides building extensions?
--------------------------------------------

I am an independent web engineer with an interest in React, JavaScript infrastructure, tooling, frameworks, libraries and design systems. Always looking for new people to collaborate with. In my spare time I also like to bake pizza.

What's your favorite part about building extensions?
----------------------------------------------------

Implementing the core functionality of the extension to the point that is already usable and useful even if not polished. I also love launch days! 

What goals do you have for the future?
--------------------------------------

I am validating a few product ideas with the goal of making something useful, fun and profitable in a "indie" way.
