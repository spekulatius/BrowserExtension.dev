[Notyfy](https://notyfy.co) aggregates your notifications across various platforms and displays them in one place. Clicking on the notification will guide you directly to the notification's platform and its content.

The extension doesn't require any login details. Sensitive data like passwords are never read or stored. Notyfy sees which of the available platforms you're logged in and gets the notifications from them.
