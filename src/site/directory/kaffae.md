[Kaffae](https://kaffae.com) provides an easy way to reflect on what you read. It automatically tracks your reading, and display report with automatic taggings. It also has memories feature where you can connect a new idea with the old reading you've done even months ago.

Inside the platform, Kaffae offers social features as well. This is where you encourage with your friends to read more. With leaderboard, you know how you are compared to other friends. Weekly goal sets a regular reading more fun and engaging.

As Jack Mezirow of the Columbia University says: "Reflection enables us to correct distortions in our beliefs and errors in problem-solving... Learning may be defined as the process of making a new or revised interpretation of the meaning of an experience, which guides subsequent understanding, appreciation and action."
