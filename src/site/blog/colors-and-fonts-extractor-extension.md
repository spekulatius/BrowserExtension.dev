What's your background?
-----------------------

After almost 7 years as PHP developer I am now a Web application Architect. I have always been passionate about everything related to technology, dev and web. But i am more of a backend guy.


What does your extension do?
----------------------------

The main goal of this extension is to simplify the extraction of the color palette and fonts names of any website.

if you are a designer or front-end developer, you can easily extract, copy and paste the color palette and the font names used in any website with just 2 clicks.

You can then copy and paste as css variables in your css/scss files.

You can also extract each color individually in RGB(A), Hex or HSL format.

Which browsers do you support?
------------------------------

The extension is available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/colors-and-fonts-extractor/) and Google [Chrome/Brave](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-and-fonts-extractor/jbnjlcapocfdcoieepfpmcjfjhjdfibo).


What motivated you to get started?
----------------------------------

Have you ever, as a front-end developer, found yourself inspecting the code of a web page to find out what are the colors and the fonts that are used in it. I personally found myself doing this a lot recently as I was looking for inspiration for one of my projects.

So I asked myself "why if I build a simple tool that does that for me ?"

And that's how "Colors and Fonts Extractor" Browser Extension was born.


Did you use a particular boilerplate to get started?
----------------------------------------------------

No starter, only good old HTML/CSS/JS.


What do you do, besides building extensions?
--------------------------------------------

Web Application Architect for a consulting firm in Paris, France and a lot of side projects as flexyform.com for the latest released one


What have you learned through building your extension?
------------------------------------------------------

As it was my first published extension I had to learn how to build one.


What goals do you have for the future?
--------------------------------------

I hope to continue building other simple and helpful extensions. And of course continue to build and grow my other side projects.
