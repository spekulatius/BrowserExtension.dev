The popular SEO tool ubersuggest has been aquired by Neil Patel. Since then the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubersuggest/nmpgaoofmjlimabncmnmnopjabbflegf) has been reworked largely. The extension now provides a set of actional SEO metrics in your search results.

Currently the following results are enhanced:

- Google Search Results
- YouTube Search Results
- Amazon Product Search Results

While the Ubersuggest service isn't free, the extension can be used for free. At this point, the extension is only available for Chrome, Chromium, Brave and other Chrome-based browsers.

We also maintain a list of [SEO browser extensions](/seo-chrome-extensions/).
